This project is a website for book searching that utilizes the Google Books API to retrieve books and enables users to mark books as favorites

I developed this project as a study on the use of Next.js with the /app structure, along with employing the useSWR library to fetch books from the Google Books API. Additionally, NextAuth.js was used for authentication with Google
